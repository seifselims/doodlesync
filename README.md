# doodlesync

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Hono, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@doodlesync/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `pnpm run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

For local PostgreSQL, copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the repository root and
set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to a generated value (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Compose
requires a nonempty password and publishes PostgreSQL only on `127.0.0.1:5432`.
The root `.env` is gitignored and supplies Compose interpolation; the service's
`env_file` does not supply variables for interpolation.

Use the same password in `apps/server/.env`:
`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:<password>@localhost:5432/doodlesync`.
Compose overrides the hostname to `postgres` for the containerized server.
Use the suggested hex password so it is safe to embed in both URLs without
percent-encoding.

Changing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` does not update credentials in an existing database
volume. If the database was already initialized, rotate its role password and
update the environment values together; do not delete the volume to change a
password.

This Compose setup is for local development. Credentials remain runtime
environment variables and can appear in container inspection or expanded
`docker compose config` output; do not share that output. For production, use
managed secrets, private database networking, and a restricted application role
instead of the `postgres` superuser.

- Target: server
- Config: `docker-compose.yml` (app Dockerfiles live in `apps/*/Dockerfile`)
- Build images: pnpm run docker:build
- Start: pnpm run docker:up
- Logs: pnpm run docker:logs
- Stop: pnpm run docker:down

Environment variables are read from each app's `.env` file (baked into web builds for public variables) and overridden in `docker-compose.yml` for container networking.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying with Docker Compose](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/docker).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `pnpm run check`

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm run dev`: Start all applications in development mode
- `pnpm run build`: Build all applications
- `pnpm run dev:web`: Start only the web application
- `pnpm run dev:server`: Start only the server
- `pnpm run check-types`: Check TypeScript types across all apps
- `pnpm run db:push`: Push schema changes to database
- `pnpm run db:generate`: Generate database client/types
- `pnpm run db:migrate`: Run database migrations
- `pnpm run db:studio`: Open database studio UI
- `pnpm run check`: Run Biome formatting and linting
- `pnpm run docker:build`: Build the Docker Compose images
- `pnpm run docker:up`: Build and start the Docker Compose stack
- `pnpm run docker:logs`: Tail logs from the Docker Compose stack
- `pnpm run docker:down`: Stop the Docker Compose stack

## Server tests

Run these commands from the repository root:

- `pnpm test`: Run all configured workspace tests once.
- `pnpm run test:transport`: Run HTTP/WebSocket transport tests.
- `pnpm run test:domain`: Run room/game rule tests as they are introduced.
- `pnpm run test:watch`: Run tests and watch for changes; stop with Ctrl+C.
- `pnpm --filter server test`: Run only the server tests.

Vitest runs in Node. Place tests alongside source using
`*.transport.test.ts` for request/socket behavior and `*.domain.test.ts` for
room/game rules. Both groups are configured in `apps/server/vitest.config.ts`.
The domain group is currently empty: its focused command exits with code 1
("No test files found") until Phase 1 adds real domain tests. No placeholder
or automatic pass for an empty suite is configured.

The existing transport tests call `createApp` with a controlled auth handler and
send direct requests. They need no running server, database, or `.env` file.
They verify routing and CORS headers, not real Better Auth login or browser CORS
enforcement. Future WebSocket tests should start and clean up a temporary listener.

## Better Auth Schema Generation

After changing auth plugins or schema options, run `pnpm run auth:generate` from the project root. The script runs the Better Auth CLI through `varlock run` from the owning app directory, loading the auth instance from `src/services.ts`. Review the schema changes, then use your ORM's migration workflow to apply them.
